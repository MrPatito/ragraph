# Containerization Disabled
# This Dockerfile is currently deprecated as containerization is not recommended
# for the current development stage.

# For local development, please use a Python virtual environment.
#
# To set up a virtual environment, run the following commands:
#   python -m venv venv
#   source venv/bin/activate
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# This setup standardizes local dependency management and execution.
#
# The Dockerfile is retained here for future reference but is not used in active development.
